The second semester continues with a focus on poetry, a Shakespeare play chosen by the teacher (some choices include Romeo & Juliet; The Taming of the Shrew; The Winter's Tale; A Midsummer's Night Dream), and a novel, also the teacher's choice. Recent titles for these books include A Long Way Gone, Monkeys, The Catcher in the Rye and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Each student also reads two outside-reading books, one per semester, chosen by individual freshman English teachers. Students study vocabulary weekly, a practice which will continue through a student's four years at The Governor's Academy. They also study grammar prescriptively (through their writing).

Texts include, but are not limited to, Julius Caesar, Death of a Salesman, The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, On the Duty of Civil Disobedience, Self-Reliance, The Great Gatsby, The American Bible, Interpreter of Maladies, and select American poets (chosen by each teacher).

Drawing on these texts, we will explore the nature of evil. Where does evil originate? Is evil the other or is evil in each one of us? In what ways does evil contribute to problems that plague us in the 21st century? We will also study evil characters in several movies, including Taylor Hackford's The Devil's Advocate and Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now and compare them to the course readings.
